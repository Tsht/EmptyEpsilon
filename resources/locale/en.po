"The Ktlitans are intelligent eight-legged creatures that resemble Earth's "
"arachnids. However, unlike most terrestrial arachnids, the Ktlitans do not "
"fight among themselves. Their common, and only, goal is their species' "
"survival.\n"
"\n"
"While they live in a hierarchical structure that resembles a hive, the lower "
"castes continue their work and start new tasks on their own even when no "
"orders come from their superiors. However, when higher castes are present, "
"the lower Ktlitans follow their orders without question or hesitation.\n"
"\n"
"Not much is known about the detailed Ktlitan hierarchy since they refuse "
"most communication. This is because they were once driven from their "
"homeworld over a span of 200 years when another species they befriended "
"betrayed them, dominated them, and drained their world of resources. Forced "
"into exile, the Ktlitans have searched for a new homeworld ever since, and "
"out of paranoia typically attack other races on sight and without warning.\n"
"\n"
"It is known, however, that the strict Ktlitan hierarchy starts with their "
"Queen and extends all the way to the bottom of their workforce, whose "
"members are called \"drones\" by the humans. Their combat capabilities "
"should not be underestimated, because while most ships in their fleets are "
"individually weak, their hive-like coordination and numbers can quickly "
"overwhelm even hardened targets. Most of their ships are unshielded, which "
"makes EMPs largely ineffective against them. Ktlitans also have no qualms "
"about applying suicidal tactics to ensure the Queen's survival."
